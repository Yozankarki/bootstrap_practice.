Hey everyone, 
This is a simple bootstrap website that I have build using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap as a practice and to learn bootstrap framework.
If you are interested in how this is build you can have a quick preview of this website on 
  ## https://yozankarki.github.io/bootstrap_practice./
  
  I have hosted this site so that you can view it before going on the code.
